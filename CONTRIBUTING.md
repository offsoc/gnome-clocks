## 1. How to Provide a Good Patch

* Make sure you have just what belongs there in the changeset.
* Read <https://handbook.gnome.org/development/commit-messages.html> carefully.
* The preferred way of appending patches to bugs is via `git bz`.
  * As an alternative you can use `git format-patch HEAD~1`.
* The bugtracker has some quite cool features; use them!
* Click on review to write comments to other or your patches or to comment comments on these patches.
* Don't be afraid about criticism! The review process is probably going to be long.
* We don't dislike you! We really appreciate your work.
